# dots

They're my dots, you know the drill.

### Installation

Clone into your homedir

- nvim: Make sure you have VimPlug installed, then run `:PlugInstall`
- i3: .config/i3/config automatically starts the following programs. If they are not installed, be sure to comment out the relavant lines:
  - `picom`
  - `feh`
  - `xss-lock`
  - `i3lock`
  - `discord`
  - `slack`
  - `spotify`
  - `kdeconnect`
  - `polybar`

Additionally, the following programs have keyboard shortcuts enabled:

- `pulseaudio`
- `brightnessctl`
- `rofi`
- `kitty`
- `loginctl`
- `i3-nagbar`
- `i3-scrot`

Finally, you will likely want to change the `output` values for `$ws1` through `$ws10`
